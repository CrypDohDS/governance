On behalf of the community, see discussion details in issue https://github.com/citycoins/governance/issues/13 and in Discord channels.

I am passing on an issue that has been raised in the community discussion. The community has voiced their interest in upgrading Citycoins to pox-3. Based on suggestions from various community members, a CCIP could be initiated to cover the following points:

- Migrate to .pox-3 for delegated stacking
- Implement the CCIP-011 style voting mechanism through a DAO proposal
- Provide retroactive payment of STX rewards for the stacking contract bug.
