## Introduction

The Stacks blockchain is a Layer 1 blockchain connected to Bitcoin, in which miners spend Bitcoin to bid for and win a fixed amount of Stacks tokens. Stackers have the option to lock up Stacks tokens for a specified amount of time, and in turn, receive a portion of the Bitcoin spent by miners proportionate to the amount Stacked[^1].

Taking this concept a level further, a new token (a "CityCoin") is created on the Stacks blockchain, following the SIP-010 fungible token standard[^2], such that CityCoins can be mined and Stacked per the methods stated above except a portion of the miner's bid would be redirected to the city's wallet overseen by a trusted third party custodian.

CityCoins leverage similar properties from the Proof of Transfer (PoX) consensus mechanism[^3] of the Stacks blockchain, programmed through a smart contract in Clarity.

This proposal describes the mining functionality for a CityCoin.

## Specification

Anyone can mine CityCoins by submitting STX into a CityCoins smart contract on the Stacks blockchain. 30% of the STX that miners forward is sent directly to a reserved wallet for the city.
